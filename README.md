# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict car prices based on various features. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates car prices using a set of relevant car features.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: The model uses algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or other regression models.
- **Data Features**: The dataset includes various car features such as make, model, year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, and more.
- **Price Estimation**: The model predicts the car price based on the input features.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries: 
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation
  - `Scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations
